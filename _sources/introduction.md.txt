Zephyr Profiling Library (ZPL), or Zephelin for short, is a library which enables capturing and reporting runtime performance metrics, for the profiling and detailed analysis of Zephyr applications, with a special focus on applications running AI/ML inference workloads.

This documentation describes the following aspects of Zephelin and the associated projects:

* {doc}`library` - provides general information on Zephelin repository, describes how to build, test and use the profiling middleware
* {doc}`configuration` - describes build-time and runtime configuration of Zephelin library
* {doc}`memory_profiling` - describes memory profiling, along with memory events
* {doc}`code_scopes` - describes the use of tracing code scopes
* {doc}`ctf_to_tef` - describes how traces are converted and processed
* {doc}`visual_interface` - describes the tool for trace visualization
