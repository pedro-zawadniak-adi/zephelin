# Zephelin Trace Viewer

Zephelin Trace Viewer is a visual interface for traces in Trace Event Format (TEF).
To fully utilize the features of the viewer, we suggest processing traces with the [CTF converter](./ctf_to_tef.md).

Go to the [GitHub-hosted Zephelin Trace Viewer](https://antmicro.github.io/zephelin-trace-viewer) to begin analyzing traces.

## Requirements

The viewer leverages workspaces to manage third-party dependencies like Speedscope.
This requires [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in version 1.x or newer, provided by [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#readme) (usually installed together with Node.js):
```bash
# Allows to use package managers without having to install them
corepack enable
# Downloads specified version of yarn and all dependencies
yarn
```

## Building

There are several predefined commands with basic utilities:
- `yarn build` - Builds for production, emitting to `dist/`
- `yarn preview` - Starts a server at `http://localhost:4173/` to test production build locally
- `yarn dev` - Starts a dev server at `http://localhost:5173/`
- `yarn lint` - Lints a code and applies all applicable fixes

## Usage

The viewer is built around [Speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope) - an interactive flamegraph viewer with support for many trace/profiling formats.

To display a trace, simply import a TEF file using the `File/Import trace` (or `Browse`) button ({numref}`main_screen_fig`).
This action will change the internal state of Speedscope, which triggers the reaction of `Additional info` section.
It gathers metadata and initializes custom panels based on available data.

### Model info panel

The model info panel displays details about the selected event and the corresponding layer.

Currently, it supports TFLite Micro ({numref}`tflm_fig`)

and microTVM runtime ({numref}`tvm_fig`).

### Plot panels

The trace viewer can also visualize resource usage (like memory or CPU load) or data from sensors (such as DIE temperature) using plots ({numref}`plots_fig`).

Panels with these plots are automatically created whenever a trace with necessary data is loaded:
* [](memory-event) events for memory plots,
* [](cpu-load-event) events for CPU load plot,
* [](die-temp-event) events for DIE temperature plot.
